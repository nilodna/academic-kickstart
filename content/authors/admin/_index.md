I'm a PhD student in physical oceanography, under the supervision of Dr. Marcelo Dottori at Oceanographic Institute of the University of S達o Paulo, Brazil. Currently, my research aims to investigate the ultra/high frequency variability of heat fluxes in the air-sea interface and how specific atmospheric systems can influence the stratification in shallow waters.
